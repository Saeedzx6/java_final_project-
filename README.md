* **Fleet Management:** Add, update, and track vehicles (Cars, SUVs, Trucks) with real-time availability status.
* **Booking Engine:** Calculate rental costs based on duration and vehicle type.
* **Customer Records:** Maintain a database of customer information and rental history.
* **Automated Invoicing:** Generate clear billing statements upon vehicle return.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling for dates, names, and vehicle IDs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
* **Data Storage:** Java Collections (ArrayLists / HashMaps) or JDBC (if applicable)
* **Tools:** Maven/Gradle (optional), Git



## 🏗 System Architecture
The project follows a modular structure to ensure clean code:
1.  **Model:** Defines the `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental` classes.
2.  **Service:** Contains the business logic for calculating prices and checking availability.
3.  **App/Main:** The entry point that handles user interaction (Console or GUI).
